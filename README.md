==============

Get a print-out every time someone commits to one of your repositories.

This app is built in Sinatra and didn't take very long to make. It's not terribly clean, but I commented anything I think useful.

It's designed to run on Heroku, hence the `Procfile`.

All the fun stuff happens in `app.rb`.
